  <p><h2>Etymology</h2></p>
  <p>While a <em>variety of theories</em> have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada, the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, meaning <em>"village"</em> or <em>"settlement"</em>.[9] In 1535, indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona.[10] Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village, but the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona);[10] by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this region as Canada.[10]</p>
    <p>In the 17th and early 18th centuries, <strong>"Canada"</strong> referred to the part of New France that lay along the St. Lawrence River.[11] In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada collectively named The Canadas; until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841.[12] Upon Confederation in 1867, Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country, and the word Dominion was conferred as the country's title.[13] The transition away from the use of Dominion was formally reflected in 1982 with the passage of the Canada Act, which refers only to Canada. Later that year, the national holiday was renamed from Dominion Day to <strong>Canada Day</strong>.[14] The term "Dominion" is also used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces, though after the Second World War the term "federal" had replaced "dominion".[15]</p>

  <p><h2>History</h2></p>
  <p><strong>Aboriginal peoples</strong><br>Aboriginal peoples in present-day Canada include the <em>First Nations, Inuit,</em> and <em>Métis,</em>[16] the latter being a mixed-blood people who originated in the mid-17th century when <strong>First Nations</strong> and Inuit people married European settlers.[16] Archaeological studies and genetic analyses have indicated a human presence in the northern <em>Yukon region</em> from 13,000–12,000 BC and in southern Ontario from 7500 BC.[17][18] These first settlers entered Canada through Beringia by way of the Bering land bridge.[19]</p>

  <p><strong>Eurpoean colonization</strong><br>The first known attempt at European colonization began when Norsemen settled briefly at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland around 1000 AD.[32] No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when Italian seafarer <em>John Cabot</em> explored Canada's Atlantic coast for England.[33] Then Basque and Portuguese mariners established seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast in the early 16th century.[34] In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the <strong>St. Lawrence River</strong>, where, on July 24, he planted a 10-metre (33 ft) cross bearing the words "Long Live the King of France" and took possession of the territory in the name of King Francis I.[35]</p>
